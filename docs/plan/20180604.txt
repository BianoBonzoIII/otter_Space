Space Architect Program
Plan for 6/04/18

Note: 
*  --> Time 
+++ --> Core Functionality 
-  --> Delegated Work 
###  --> Collaborative Work 
()  --> Might not include

 Although work remains to be done on the intro, we must keep moving forward
to accomplish core functionality.
+++ (###) complete transition into state 2 during the class period. Requires some work with user input
- one member read up on the concept of noise and how to change apparent density on screen. update gas 
- other two members develop algo for star constructor and formation animation from state 1.


This team is mostly on track. We envision the following progress:

by the end of 6/5 get SolarSystem done and look at ways to incorporate collision functionality.

use 6/6 to incorporate end stage messages and

6/7 for final tweaks and smoothing user interface/ updating documentation + usage
